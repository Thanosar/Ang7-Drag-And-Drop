# Getting started

Here is a list of 4 things we need to be able to use the Drag and Drop tool in Angular 7

1) 
//cd to a preferred location
// run the command below
ng new dragdrop

2)
//Angular Material installed on the above app
ng add @angular/material

3) Import Drag Drop module in the app module file. (app.module.ts)

4) Rendering a list. Open the app component file and add an array of hotels for example.
